# Turn Timer
If the gap between note chunks is around 16 steps (1 measure), then the dial appears (changes depending on time signature)!
Supports opponent play! ***Does not show up in Co-Op mode yet.***

Plans:
* Code in pixel support, somehow.
* Potentially code Co-Op mode support.
* Add duration text potentially?

Bugs:
* Does not work with multiple strumLines yet.
* Dial can sometimes fade out early. Now idea why this happens.
